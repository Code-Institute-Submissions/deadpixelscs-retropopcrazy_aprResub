# RETRO POP CRAZY

Retro Pop Crazy is a website for collectors worldwide of Funko Pop figures. This can be used as a resource with detailed information about each Funko Pop in my collection. Take a trip down memory lane with a nostalgic throwback to the 80's and 90's cartoon and Tv shows that we all grew up and loved. Funko gets licensed brands and makes figurines based on their characters. These can range from your standard Pop! 
 to special movie moments, extra large 10" figures and much more. In particular they release Exclusives that quickly become rare and of value due to their low production runs of 2000 or so pieces worldwide. Funko Pop is currently a $700 million market worldwide. Every year brands like Comic Con stage events for rare and exclusive Pops! for the general public to attend.

This website will focus on the franchises that I enjoyed most as a child like the Masters of the Universe, Star Wars and Marvel as well as introducing some new franchises like Stranger Things, The Mandalorian and a miscellaneous section.

Each Pop! will be showcased from my collection with personal fan art that I have designed, the franchise or brand, a description about the character, its rare rating, current market value and catalogue number. These will all go in the Vault section of the website where users can select their favourite franchise and it will take them to a section on the page where they can see all this information and imagery.

There will also be a Radar page added later to the site which is a news feature focusing on specific new releases or rare and exclusive Pops!, details of upcoming events and links to purchase from global retailers.

I hope you enjoy the website and please sign up to our monthly newsletter for news, information, reviews and competitions.
