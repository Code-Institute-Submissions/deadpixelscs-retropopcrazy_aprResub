# RETRO POP CRAZY

Retro Pop Crazy is a website for collectors worldwide of Funko Pop figures. This can be used as a resource with detailed information about each Funko Pop in my collection. Take a trip down memory lane with a nostalgic throwback to the 80's and 90's cartoon and Tv shows that we all grew up and loved. Funko gets licensed brands and makes figurines based on their characters. These can range from your standard Pop! 
 to special movie moments, extra large 10" figures and much more. In particular they release Exclusives that quickly become rare and of value due to their low production runs of 2000 or so pieces worldwide. Funko Pop is currently a $700 million market worldwide. Every year brands like Comic Con stage events for rare and exclusive Pops! for the general public to attend.

This website will focus on the franchises that I enjoyed most as a child like the Masters of the Universe, Star Wars and Marvel as well as introducing some new franchises like Stranger Things, The Mandalorian and a miscellaneous section.

Each Pop! will be showcased from my collection with personal fan art that I have designed, the franchise or brand, a description about the character, its rare rating, current market value and catalogue number. These will all go in the Vault section of the website where users can select their favourite franchise and it will take them to a section on the page where they can see all this information and imagery.

There will also be a Radar page added later to the site which is a news feature focusing on specific new releases or rare and exclusive Pops!, details of upcoming events and links to purchase from global retailers.

I hope you enjoy the website and please sign up to our monthly newsletter for news, information, reviews and competitions.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
